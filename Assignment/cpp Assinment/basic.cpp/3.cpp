Hereâ€™s the difference between OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)and 
POP (Procedure-Oriented Programming):

1.Feature              | OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)                      | POP (Procedure-Oriented Programming)    

2.Basic Unit           | Objects (combining data and methods)                  | Functions (procedures to operate on data)     

3.Focus                | Data and objects                                      | Functions and logic                             

4.Data Access          | Encapsulated (data hidden within objects)             | Data is shared and accessible by all functions    

5.Code Reusability     | Promoted through inheritance and polymorphism         | Limited code reusability                         

6.Complexity Handling  | Easier to manage due to modular structure             | Difficult to manage as program size grows   

7.Security             | High, due to encapsulation and access control         | Low, as data is globally accessible          

8.Example Languages    | Java, C++, Python                                     | C, Pascal, Fortran                                            

In short, OOP focuses on objects and data security, while POP focuses on functions and procedures, with less emphasis on data encapsulation.
